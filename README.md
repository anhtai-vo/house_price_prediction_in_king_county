Multiple linear regression, Ridge regression and model evaluation using Cross-validation method.

Using the linear regression model in machine learning to train and evaluate the results, can be easy to compare the 'Actual vs Fitted values' in the train and test set. I also perform multiple linear regression and polynomial regression. In this project, I use cross-validation to calculate the average R-squared of k-folds. Finding the best regularization parameter to minimize the test error in Ridge regression. 
I use the dataset 'kc_house_data.csv' source from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).
